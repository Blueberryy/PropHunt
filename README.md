# PropHunt Neu

PropHunt Neu is my own take on the classic hide 'n seek gamemode for Team Fortress 2.

## Features

* Ability to disguise as any prop on the map
    * Including static props, dynamic props and other model-based entities
    * Player health scales with size of selected prop
* Centralized prop configuration to blacklist and configure props
* Greatly improved Hunter (BLU) gameplay
    * Dynamically calculated self-damage values depending on used weapon
    * Minimal weapon and class restrictions
* Works out-of-the-box on any arena map without any additional configs
* Highly configurable using ConVars and configuration files
