# PropHunt Neu

PropHunt Neu is my own take on the classic hide-and-seek gamemode for Team Fortress 2.

This is **not** a rewrite of Powerlord's [Prop Hunt Redux](https://github.com/powerlord/sourcemod-prophunt), but his plugin served as an inspiration.

## Features

* Ability to choose any prop in the map (similar to Garry's Mod Prop Hunt)
    * Including `prop_static` and `prop_dynamic`
    * Player health scales with prop size
    * Global prop config to blacklist and configure allowed props
* Minimal weapon and class restrictions
* Works on any arena map without any additional configs
* Highly configurable

## Requirements

* SourceMod 1.10+
* [StaticProps](https://github.com/sigsegv-mvm/StaticProps)
* [DHooks 2 with Detour Support](https://github.com/peace-maker/DHooks2/tree/dynhooks)
* [TF2Items](https://github.com/asherkin/TF2Items)
* [TF2 Econ Data](https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFEconData)
* [TF2Attributes](https://github.com/FlaminSarge/tf2attributes)
